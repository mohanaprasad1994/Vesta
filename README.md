Audio assistant for iwatch

Connect watch to a speaker (bluetooth) to play music.
Force press to invoke help.
Simple speech recognition supported.

Due to limitations of watchOS:
- Used timer to initiate a new screen to mimic alarm notification. Because watchOS notification doesn't support longer music playing/customized music playing.
- Music can only be paused but not stopped. (maybe there's way to fix this?)
