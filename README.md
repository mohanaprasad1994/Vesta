# Vesta
Audio assistant for iwatch

Connect watch to a speaker (bluetooth) to play music.
Force press to invoke help.

Due to limitations of watchOS:
- Used timer to initiate a new screen to mimic alarm notification. Because watchOS notification doesn't support longer music playing/customized music playing.
- Music can only be paused but not stopped. (maybe there's way to fix this?)


TODO:
- (maybe) Add newly added schedule to "alarm" page
- Setting button on main page, which includes help and import
- Add music playlist (non-customizable) element to music player screen
